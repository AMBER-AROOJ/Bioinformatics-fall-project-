summary 
The analysis identified a coding gene from the provided DNA sequence, which was translated into functional protein. RNA structure prediction revealed stable secondary structures. Protein domain analysis suggested functional relevance, while localization tools predicted the protein to be localized mainly in the cytoplasmmic region. phylogenetic analysis showed revolutionary conservation Among related species, interaction analysis revealed biological significant protein partners
